# tint-lm

This project is an experiment to create vocabulary supported short programs. Each program consists of only one, two, or three words with no grammar rules.

# Examples that happen to overlap with English commands

"drive home"

"turn TV off"

"turn volume down"

# How does it work

This project is a long goal for LM programming. The short command is "compiled" by LM to create an intermediate program in another host language like C or Python.

This is an extreme form of program synthesis that uses the full expressive and logical inference capabilities that make LM unique.
